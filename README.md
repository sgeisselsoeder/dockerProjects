# dockerProjects

This project is intended to investigate and explain why and how Docker can be used improve the reproducibility of physics analyses.

It was developed as a part of ASTERICS (www.asterics2020.eu), a joint effort in which multiple collaborations investigate techniques to tackle common challenges. 

In this repository the details are implemented for the example of KM3NeT, a neutrino telescope and member of ASTERICS.
